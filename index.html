            <h1>Hi</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>My hobby is singing. I find it intresting and enjoyable. I also sing to de-stress after a long day of school. My friend love singing too, especially my bestfriend Saachi. I go to sangeetha classes. My sangeetha teacher's name is Shylaja and she is my aunt. I like my sangeetha classes. I am currently learning senior lessons and juniour theory. I like all genres, but my favourite genre is hip-hop. My favourite artists are Ed Sheeren, Charlie Puth and Camilla Cabello. I don't really have any favourite songs as I like most songs. Me and my best friend Saachi always talk about the latest songs. We spend a lot of time talking on the phone and most of it is talking about songs. In school, our music teacher likes my and Saachi's singing. I know this is not about singing, but me and Saachi know how to play flutes. It is also said that singing is good to help lower stress, boost immunity and lung function, enhance memory, improve mental health, and helps cope with physical and emotional pain. In the end of the day, I love singing.</p>
